Preprocessor Directive
======================

> #include <stdio.h>

Preprocessor directives are used to include other files in the current file.

Inject before the compiler starts to process the file.

(source code) -> preprocessor -> (expanded source code) -> compiler -> (compiled code)

* stdio.h: standard input output file
* .h: header file
* contains declarations (prototypes) of functions linke printf, scanf, etc.
